## Feature Learning-based Neural Network Predicting Moving Averages of Financial Time Series

This paper proposes a model predicting the long-term moving average of financial time series by using a feature-learning based neural network. Specifically, the proposed model having a fully connected neural network with stochastic gradient descent is trained to predict future moving averages based on the feature maps of past moving averages. The proposed model is able to obtain feature maps of past moving averages by encoding past moving averages with two-dimensional convolutions and two-dimensional max pooling for enhanced feature extraction of both sequential and periodic relationships.
